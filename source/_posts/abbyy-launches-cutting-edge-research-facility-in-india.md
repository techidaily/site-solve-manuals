[ABBYY](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) is meeting growing global demand for its purpose-built AI solutions with the opening of new offices in India. A research and development (R&D) center located in Bengaluru and Center of Excellence in New Delhi are pivotal to enhancing ABBYY's capabilities to deliver localized solutions and drive success for partners and customers worldwide. 

Leading the opening of the offices is Yathiraj Shetty Kasargod, the newly appointed director of Product Operations for ABBYY India.

We are excited to expand our global footprint by opening a new R&D center and Center of Excellence in India.

India's vibrant tech ecosystem and unrivaled talent offer tremendous opportunities for organizations to leverage our AI-powered intelligent automation offerings. I welcome Yathiraj to the ABBYY team as we mark this strategic milestone in our commitment to better serve our customers and partners.

Ulf Persson, Chief Executive Officer at ABBYY

Demand for ABBYY AI in India resulted in attracting three times the attendees at the ABBYY AI Pulse Developer Conference held in Bengaluru July 24-25\. In fact, Forrester1 reported that technology spending in India is estimated to increase to $54.5 billion by 2027 with spending in AI-augmented software and services outpacing other IT categories. The increase is attributed to global demand for AI and automation for driving growth and operational efficiency. 

It is a pleasure to join ABBYY and spearhead the expansion in India to enhance and diversify our capabilities. I look forward to working with the global ABBYY team to meet customers where they do business.

Yathiraj Shetty Kasargod, director of Product Operations for ABBYY India

ABBYY will hire new talent for its R&D center and Center of Excellence in India, complementing its existing R&D footprint across EMEA and North America, which includes development centers in Hungary, Serbia, Cyprus, and the United States. ABBYYâ€™s other APAC locations include Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, and Australia.
