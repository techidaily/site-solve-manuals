ABBYY, a global leader in Digital IQ technologies and solutions, today announced new iOS 13-powered updates to FineScanner AI and Business Card Reader mobile applications. The latest updates deliver expanded capabilities allowing iOS users to manage mobile apps using Siri voice assistant and automate document processing without additional configuration. With the new enhancements, users can ask their smart assistant to display a previously scanned text or business card, digitize a new document, or initiate a chain of other actions.

As AI proliferates into every aspect of our lives, voice assistants are becoming the norm worldwide. A new study conducted by [Microsoft](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/insights/2019-voice-report "2019 Voice Report") found that 72% of respondents reported using a digital assistant in the past 6 months. The new capabilities in ABBYY FineScanner AI and ABBYY BCR will provide great hands-free experience to users working with information on the go or in any other situations where voice control is crucial for accessibility or process execution.

ABBYY FineScanner comes with AI-enabled functionality that allows users to instantly find documents and books in the gallery, digitize them into PDF and JPEG, and recognize text in 193 languages without network access. The latest upgrade makes it fully compatible with the new iOS 13 with built-in support for Siri Shortcuts and custom voice commands. The user can set up a chain of actions such as opening a PDF document, book, or recognized text from FineScanner and send them via email. Siri voice shortcuts also allow the user to find and open scans of important documents, such as their travel passport, insurance policy or an air ticket, without opening the app. Additionally, the latest version of FineScanner has been enhanced with VoiceOver technology. Now all the interface elements and the results of text recognition displayed on the screen are voiced out loud, allowing visually impaired users to work with texts and documents faster and easier.

ABBYY Business Card Reader provides a reliable and accurate way to scan and save business cards to a smartphone in 25 languages. All business data including first name, last name, company, phone numbers, email, website, job title, and photo, is automatically added to BCR, smartphone contacts or Salesforce CRM. With the new support for iOS 13, BCR easily opens the required business card without running the application. All the user needs to do is pronounce a contact’s name or input it in the Siri interface.

**Bruce Orcutt**, Senior Vice President of Product Marketing at ABBYY, commented: "With the rise of AI, an ever-growing number of smartphone users are turning to modern voice assistants for support in everyday and business tasks. Latest advances in speech recognition coupled with the widespread adoption of voice interfaces have further reduced the time spent on the usual taps and scrolls on mobile devices. With the new enhancements to ABBYY BCR and FineScanner, knowledge workers, from insurers and consultants to field managers and sales executives will get both a powerful working tool and a smart digital companion."
