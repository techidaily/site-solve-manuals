#### _2020 kicks off a new decade and a new era at ABBYY._ 

  
ABBYY, a Digital Intelligence company, has streamlined its Sales Organization uniting Sales in North and Latin America, Japan, Australia and New Zealand into one structure and appointing Joe Rayfield as its leader and Vice President.

Current heads of sales in North America, Latin America as well as head of business in Japan, Australia and New Zealand will report to Joe.

“I am happy to be joining ABBYY at a time when the Digital Intelligence technologies and solutions are so much in demand in the market, especially in finance, transportation and healthcare,” said Joe Rayfield.

Joe said he sees potential in the Digital Intelligence market. “According to PwC, 45% of work activities can be automated, which would save [$2 trillion](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/outsourcing-shared-services-centers/assets/robotics-process-automation.pdf) in global workforce costs,” he said.

The new sales structure plans to accelerate customers’ projects implementation and time-to-value through tighter collaboration with the Customer Success and Professional Services teams.

“With the talent of the people we have in our organisation in ABBYY, I am confident that we will be able to find solutions to our clients’ business goals and address their pain points, while underscoring ABBYY’s position as a leader in the market,” said ABBYY’s Chief Sales Officer Bodo Wagener.

Joe, an accomplished sales and business development professional, has served as Vice President of ABBYY Process Intelligence since ABBYY’s acquisition of TimelinePI, Inc. in August, 2019\. He brings more than 20 years of experience working in software and IT markets, his experience covering a wide range of technology offerings, from data and hosting networks to enterprise SaaS solutions. Prior to joining Timeline, he held multiple positions at Kofax, including Senior Vice President of Sales for Business Intelligence, Vice President of Sales for the UK and Ireland, Vice President of Sales for Australia, and New Zealand, and Senior Vice President of Global Channel and Alliances.
