[ABBYY](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), a Digital Intelligence company, announced today that it has successfully completed the SOC2 Type 2 certifications for its leading content transformation solutions, ABBYY FlexiCapture Cloud and ABBYY OCR SDK. This is in addition to previously awarded SOC 2 certifications for [ABBYY Vantage](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), the first no-code platform for intelligent document processing, and [ABBYY Timeline](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/), a comprehensive process and task mining solution that enables organizations to accelerate their time to value when automating processes. The certifications further strengthen ABBYY’s commitment to protecting customer data in a global market.

“Earning the trust of our clients and ensuring security of their data is a continued commitment,” said **Paul Nizov, Chief Information Security Officer at ABBYY**. “The new certifications validate our secure software development and deployment that aligns with the company’s innovation roadmap, and we look forward to continuing to build trust through further similar milestones.”

The System and Organization Controls (SOC) 2 is one of three reports available under the SOC framework, defined by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). It is designed to ensure that third-party service providers (Service organizations) can securely manage data to protect the interests and privacy of their clients. SOC 2 compliance verifies the existence and effectiveness of security controls relevant to Trust Service Principles (TSPs) of Confidentiality, Availability, Processing Integrity, Privacy, and Security.

All of ABBYY’s on-premises solutions do not share any personal or commercial data that are digitized and analyzed by customers. Customers have complete control of such data while using their on-premises solutions. ABBYY cloud solutions use trusted service providers, strict access control, and strong encryption. Furthermore, ABBYY is compliant with applicable regulations regarding commercial and personal data use, such as GDPR and CCPA.

SOC 2 reports are available upon request and a signed NDA.
