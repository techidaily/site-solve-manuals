ABBYY, a Digital Intelligence company, has appointed industry veteran Robert Youngjohns as Chairman of the Board. In this position Robert will work with the CEO and executive management team to shape ABBYY’s global enterprise growth strategy and execution.

Based in Silicon Valley, Robert was previously the Executive Vice President and General Manager of HP Software at Hewlett Packard Enterprise. At HPE he was instrumental in the $9 billion merger of HPE's Software Business Segment with Micro Focus and he served a member of HPE's Executive Council. Prior to HPE, Robert was President of Microsoft North America. Additionally, he has held senior leadership roles at Callidus Cloud, Sun Microsystems and IBM. Currently, Robert sits on the board of a select number of growth companies in the technology sector. Robert holds a Master's degree with honors in physics and philosophy from Oxford University.

“We are delighted to welcome Robert to the ABBYY board and have him work alongside us to continue our strong growth and expand our position as a leading Digital Intelligence vendor,” commented Ulf Persson, CEO of ABBYY. “Robert’s vision and extensive experience as a transformational force in the enterprise software industry will serve us well as we deepen our investments in new products and markets to accelerate our success as a critical player in the digital transformation revolution.”

ABBYY has earned [double-digit revenue growth](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/) for three consecutive years and is recognized by [The Everest Group as a leader in Intelligent Document Processing](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/).
