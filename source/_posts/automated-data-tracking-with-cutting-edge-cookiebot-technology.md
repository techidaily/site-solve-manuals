#### _Strategic Partnerships and Executive Appointments Position the Company for Accelerated Market Penetration of its Content IQ Solutions_

During fourth quarter of 2018, ABBYY content IQ solutions and services became more widely and readily available from new strategic partners and robotic process automation (RPA) vendors’ digital marketplaces. ABBYY’s momentum in forming new partnerships and gaining more enterprise customers is attributed to organizations’ increasing deployment of RPA technologies, and the need to make the software robots smarter. Additionally, new executives were appointed to drive continued global expansion of the company’s AI-enabling technologies, and ABBYY senior executives spoke at major tech conferences about the opportunities for integrating AI capabilities into the enterprise.

“ABBYY has remained focused on two important fronts – developing the most innovative technologies and solutions using machine learning, natural language processing and intelligent capture, and delivering business value to our customers and partners,” commented Ulf Persson, Chief Executive Officer at ABBYY. “The relationships we’ve built is a testament to our dedication and aspiration to remain a global leader in delivering content IQ solutions that enable organizations to digitally operate better and deliver a better experience to their customers.”
