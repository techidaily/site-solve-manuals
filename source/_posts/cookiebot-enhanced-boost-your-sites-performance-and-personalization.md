_Highlights Technology that Unlocks Data to Improve Business Outcomes and Growth at Booth #H33_

ABBYY®, a leading provider of technologies and solutions to action information, is exhibiting at [The Al Summit San Francisco](https://theaisummit.com/sanfrancisco/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SAN-FRAN-2017-BROCHURE.pdf) Sept. 27 - 28 at booth #H33 where it will highlight its latest artificial intelligence (Al) technology including machine learning and natural language processing that helps organizations better understand and drive context and outcomes from their data. Bruce Orcutt, senior vice president of Product Marketing at ABBYY, will share a visionary case study titled, "Using Al to Transform Business Documents into Business Value," on Thursday, Sept. 28 at 3:15 p.m. PT.

The Al Summit is a pioneering show in the Al space for business where senior business CxOs, data scientists, developers and engineers, Al visionaries, Al startup innovators, researchers and media go to learn about the most innovative Al technology. Ground-breaking solutions that are transforming business productivity today and transforming organizations in the future are showcased.

"Al adoption is currently being deployed by many organizations, with the financial services industry being one of the most active for Al adoption," commented Bruce Orcutt, senior vice president of Product Marketing at ABBYY. "Attendees at The Al Summit will discover that critical business and customer data - whether originated in paper or born digital - is locked and hidden within documents and the most cost effective and timely way to make that information visible and actionable is via Al.. Because customers have higher levels of expectation for response and service, Al will be a significant enabler for driving a better user experience and ensuring trust by using machine learning technology and natural language processing. Financial institutions can finally understand text, context and relationships previously locked within business documents."
