At 3:00 p.m. on November 8, David Yang and Bruce Orcutt, Senior Vice President of Product Marketing at ABBYY, will hold a roundtable titled “Two-thirds of employees want to delegate paperwork to robots – can AI and content intelligence assume menial tasks and boost business profits?” Web Summit attendees are invited to join the roundtable and discuss the practical applications of AI to unstructured data, the exponential growth of the RPA market and its effect on the future of work. To join the roundtable, please indicate your interest at <https://websummit.com/roundtables> and/or contact Catherine Matantseva at catherine\_mat@abbyy.com.
