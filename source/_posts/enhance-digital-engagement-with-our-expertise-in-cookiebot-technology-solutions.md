ABBYY, a global leader in Content IQ technologies and solutions, today announced a series of innovations to ABBYY FlexiCapture, an AI-enabled enterprise platform to automate document processing workflows and convert unstructured content into structured data for better business outcomes. The updates include the launch of the ABBYY FlexiCapture Cloud REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) and the introduction of the new Real-Time Capture technology for real-time document processing in the cloud.

As companies strive to execute their digital transformation strategies and look to automate processes through enablement and execution of their digital workforce, they are challenged by the need to deploy and support intelligent automation capabilities. Traditional on-premise models can often present challenges to agility as well as impact development, deployment, and support objectives. ABBYY has addressed this challenge by making the market-leading Content IQ platform FlexiCapture available in the cloud. Deployed on Microsoft Azure, FlexiCapture Cloud delivers all the benefits of its cloud services directly to customers, developers, and ISVs through REST API and web interfaces. This way, ABBYY offers advanced content classification, extraction, validation, and integration to customers supporting their customer onboarding, claims processing, new account opening, accounts payable, and mortgage origination challenges.

“ABBYY Content IQ solutions and services are designed to empower enterprises to automate their content-centric processes regardless of where the data lives, in the cloud or on premises. This release is an important step in the execution of our commitment to support customers in their cloud implementations,” comments Bruce Orcutt, Senior Vice President of Product Marketing at ABBYY. “The new FlexiCapture REST API simplifies integration and use of ABBYY’s advanced capabilities all orchestrated and driven within their core business application or service. This expands the addressable market for the customer, offers a modern interface preferred by developers, and enables real-time support, which improves customer service, usability, and engagement.”

ABBYY FlexiCapture Cloud REST API allows enterprises, ERP vendors, system integrators, and ISVs to integrate FlexiCapture as a cloud Content IQ service inside their systems. The API makes it easy for applications and services to submit content to ABBYY and receive real-time responses related to data, context, entities, and relationships. It enables customers to extract meaning from documents, continuously train the system, and develop custom verification processes. For example, a provider of accounts payable automation solutions, who needs to process customer invoices in the cloud with high data extraction quality and performance, will benefit from easy integration via REST API. The data capture services delivered by the REST API are running in the customer’s region of choice on [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/ "Microsoft Azure").

Real-Time Capture released in beta makes FlexiCapture Cloud suitable for use cases where immediate response and return of structured data are important, such as customer onboarding, new account opening, and mortgage origination.

ABBYY FlexiCapture Cloud provides all the functionality required to understand and create meaning from documents by converting unstructured content into structured, actionable information, enabling organizations of all sizes to deliver cloud-based document processing services and solutions. The service-automation platform classifies documents and extracts relevant data from any document types. The robust auto-learning capability powered by machine learning accelerates time to production and helps organizations improve customer satisfaction. ABBYY provides cloud maintenance and upgrades, guarantees security and compliance, and offers 24-hour customer support included in the subscription.
