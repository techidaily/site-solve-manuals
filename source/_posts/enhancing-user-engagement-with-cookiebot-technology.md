The[image-to-text application TextGrabbe](https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id438475005?mt=8) got installed 1,000,000 times in just 5 days, after being featured by the App Store, [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/topics/education) and [AppShopper](http://appshopper.com/prices/free).

The App Store Editors [say](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2016/06/16/text-grabber-free-app-of-week/): “_Capturing printed words and magically morphing them into easy-to-edit digital text is TextGrabber’s bread and butter. But we love it nearly as much for the sci-fi cool factor of being able to instantly translate Italian restaurant menus, French fashion magazines, and Japanese graphic novels into our native language”._

Created by ABBYY, an international provider of OCR technologies, TextGrabber scans, translates and saves text or QR-codes from any printed material. The app recognizes 60+ languages on device, no Internet connection needed. Then you can edit the captured text, hear it via VoiceOver, translate it into 90+ languages and send it as a text message or e-mail, or share it on social media (Facebook, Twitter or Evernote). The app is free on the App Store till June 23, usually it costs $4.99\. It is also available on Google Play. Translation is available as a separate in-app purchase.

These features make TextGrabber not only a life-saver for anyone travelling abroad, but also a great help for visually impaired people, due to its recently updated VoiceOver and adjustable font sizes.

Over 750,000 documents have been recognized and 100,000 translations made in TextGrabber in just 5 days of the App Store featuring, since June 16\. The most popular languages are English, Chinese, Arabic, Russian, German, Spanish and Japanese.

TextGrabber has previously won multiple awards in Mobile Productivity App, Mobile Image Capture App and Text Input categories at the Mobile Star Awards, and has been called “the[Best Image-to-Text App for iPhone](http://lifehacker.com/5829568/the-best-image-to-text-app-for-iphone)” by Lifehacker.com. The app is currently [#2 in the Education category](https://www.producthunt.com/topics/education) on Product Hunt and is [featured by AppShoper](http://appshopper.com/prices/free).

__«I am glad TextGrabber and OCR in general get real attention of the public. These are the technologies we’ve been working on for years, that make people’s lives significantly easier. And that’s the most important thing”_, comments Artem Kumpel, ABBYY Vice President and Head of Mobile.
