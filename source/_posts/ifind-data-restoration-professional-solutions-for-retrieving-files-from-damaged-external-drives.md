Nowadays we need to store more and more data, then the U disk cannot meet our needs. As a result, the external hard disk stands out. Compared with u disk, the external hard disk has many advantages.

* The characteristics of large capacity.
* Fast transmission speed.
* Stable performance.

However, the data loss of the external hard disk is the highest among all storage devices. We are facing much more **external hard drive recovery** problems nowadays.

In addition to the error deletion, there are two types of failures that mobile hard disks often encounter.

* _Hard disk damaged, unable to open it._

## 1, Damaged External Hard Drive

We often encounter this situation when we use the external hard disk: the external hard disk is connected properly, the operating system can correctly display the drive letter and icons of the external hard disk, but when you double-click the icon, you can’t open the hard drive, and the window below will pop up.

This means the external hard drive is damaged, There are many reasons for this failure. But once that happens, don’t be nervous, we’ll try to fix it at first.

1. Press “Windows + X”, then knock “A”, then pop up the terminal program.
2. Enter “chkdsk drive letter:/f” in the terminal program, press the enter key, then run the Windows disk repair tool.
3. After the disk repair tool running ends, reconnect the external hard disk. If the problem is not solved, we recommend using [iFinD Data Recovery](https://tools.techidaily.com/ifind-recovery/products/) to recover the data in the damaged disk.
