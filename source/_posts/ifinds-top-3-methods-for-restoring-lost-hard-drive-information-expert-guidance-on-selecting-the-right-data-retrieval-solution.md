## ****Common Scenarios of Hard Drive Data Loss**

There are several scenarios that are both accidental and inadvertent when you lose data from a hard drive. These scenarios include:

****Hardware Failure:** This can be a somewhat inevitable scenario when you lose data on a hard drive. Hard drives can automatically fail at the end of their lifespans. However, failure can also happen in situations like mishandling, power surges, fire, or water that can damage its internal components or make the drive dead.

****Formatting:** When you format your PC while installing Windows or format a non-boot volume or external hard drive, this can happen.

****Corruption:** This happens when an internal hard drive gets corrupted. In such cases, boot won’t happen because of damage to the master boot record or boot configuration data.

****Deletion:** This is one of the most common scenarios when you can lose data. for example, You deleted certain files like a document, photo, video, email message, audio, or archive file that go to the Recycle the Recycle Bin but hit the Deleted Key without peeking into these files.

## ****3 Methods to Recover Hard Drive Data**

### ****Check the recycle bin for Recover Hard Drive Data**

This is a common and easy method to recover data from the recycle bin. As we delete files from our laptop or computer, they go directly to the recycle bin instead of being permanently deleted. The only time this doesn’t happen is when the file is too large to be sent there or the recycle bin is already full.

So, this is a viable option to check the recycle bin before moving on to any other data recovery solutions:

Open the Recycle Bin on your computer.

As it opens, you can see all the deleted files there. Right-click your file and select “Restore” to retrieve files back to other drives. If you want to recover multiple files, hold Ctrl and select all desired files before clicking right to recover them.

All the deleted files will be delivered back to their original locations as soon as you click on Restore. Alternatively, you can also drag all the files from the recycle bin to a location of your choice. Try the next method if you are unable to recover files from the recycle bin.

### ****Restore Files from a Backup**

This is another easy method to Recover Hard Drive Data files. Of course, this method is only viable if you have a backup to recover the data from. Windows equips you with the backup utilities to back up your data, which require you to configure them. File History is one such tool that takes snapshots of your files. It enables you to restore a working version of them.

If you have enabled File History, you can make a copy of your files by following these simple steps:

First of all launch the Start menu, and type “file history” in the search bar. Select File History from the Control Panel search result.

Then click on the Restore personal files option from the File History Control Panel window.

Navigate to the location where files were stored. Use the navigation arrows to point to a point in time where files were stored in the folder. Select which files you want to recover. Then, click on the restore button. As the restore process completes, all the files will be back in the folder.
