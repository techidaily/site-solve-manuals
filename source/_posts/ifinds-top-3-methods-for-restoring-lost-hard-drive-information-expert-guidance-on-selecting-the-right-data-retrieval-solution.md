### ****Check the recycle bin for Recover Hard Drive Data**

This is a common and easy method to recover data from the recycle bin. As we delete files from our laptop or computer, they go directly to the recycle bin instead of being permanently deleted. The only time this doesn’t happen is when the file is too large to be sent there or the recycle bin is already full.

So, this is a viable option to check the recycle bin before moving on to any other data recovery solutions:

Open the Recycle Bin on your computer.

All the deleted files will be delivered back to their original locations as soon as you click on Restore. Alternatively, you can also drag all the files from the recycle bin to a location of your choice. Try the next method if you are unable to recover files from the recycle bin.
